# OIP-721： Non-Fungible Token Standard 
## Simple Summary
A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds.
## Abstract
The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for NFTs within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer NFTs.  
We considered use cases of NFTs being owned and transacted by individuals as well as consignment to third party brokers/wallets/auctioneers (“operators”). NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets. We considered a diverse universe of assets, and we know you will dream up many more:  
- Physical property — houses, unique artwork  
- Virtual collectables — unique pictures of kittens, collectable cards  
- “Negative value” assets — loans, burdens and other responsibilities  
In general, all houses are distinct and no two kittens are alike. NFTs are *distinguishable* and you must track the ownership of each one separately.  
## Motivation
A standard interface allows wallet/broker/auction applications to work with any NFT on OKB Chain . We provide simple OIP-721 smart contracts as well as contracts that track an *arbitrarily* large number of NFTs. Additional applications are discussed below.
## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
**Every OIP-721 compliant contract must implement the OIP`721` and OIP`165` interfaces** (subject to “caveats” below):

A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the **wallet interface** if it will accept safe transfers.

```
The **metadata extension** is OPTIONAL for OIP-721 smart contracts (see “caveats”, below). This allows your smart contract to be interrogated for its name and for details about the assets which your NFTs represent.  
```

/// @title OIP-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, optional metadata extension
/// @dev See https://OIPs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/draft/OIP-721.html
///  Note: the OIP-165 identifier for this interface is 0x5b5e139f.
interface OIP721Metadata /* is OIP721 */ {
    
    /// @notice A descriptive name for a collection of NFTs in this contract
    function name() external view returns (string _name);
    
    /// @notice An abbreviated name for NFTs in this contract
    function symbol() external view returns (string _symbol);
    
    /// @notice A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given asset.
    /// @dev Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT. URIs are defined in RFC
    ///  3986. The URI may point to a JSON file that conforms to the "OIP721
    ///  Metadata JSON Schema".
    function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (string);
}
```
This is the “OIP721 Metadata JSON Schema” referenced above.  
```
{
    "title": "Asset Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "image": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this NFT represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive."
        }
    }
}
```
The **enumeration extension** is OPTIONAL for OIP-721 smart contracts (see “caveats”, below). This allows your contract to publish its full list of NFTs and make them discoverable.  
```

/// @title OIP-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, optional enumeration extension
/// @dev See https://OIPs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/draft/OIP-721.html
///  Note: the OIP-165 identifier for this interface is 0x780e9d63.
interface OIP721Enumerable /* is OIP721 */ {

    /// @notice Count NFTs tracked by this contract
    /// @return A count of valid NFTs tracked by this contract, where each one of
    ///  them has an assigned and queryable owner not equal to the zero address
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    
    /// @notice Enumerate valid NFTs
    /// @dev Throws if `_index` >= `totalSupply()`.
    /// @param _index A counter less than `totalSupply()`
    /// @return The token identifier for the `_index`th NFT,
    ///  (sort order not specified)
    function tokenByIndex(uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256);
    
    /// @notice Enumerate NFTs assigned to an owner
    /// @dev Throws if `_index` >= `balanceOf(_owner)` or if
    ///  `_owner` is the zero address, representing invalid NFTs.
    /// @param _owner An address where we are interested in NFTs owned by them
    /// @param _index A counter less than `balanceOf(_owner)`
    /// @return The token identifier for the `_index`th NFT assigned to `_owner`,
    ///   (sort order not specified)
    function tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address _owner, uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256);
}
```
### Caveats
The 0.4.20 Solidity interface grammar is not expressive enough to document the OIP-721 standard. A contract which complies with OIP-721 MUST also abide by the following:  
- Solidity issue #3412: The above interfaces include explicit mutability guarantees for each function. Mutability guarantees are, in order weak to strong: `payable`, implicit nonpayable, `view`, and `pure`. Your implementation MUST meet the mutability guarantee in this interface and you MAY meet a stronger guarantee. For example, a `payable` function in this interface may be implemented as nonpayable (no state mutability specified) in your contract. We expect a later Solidity release will allow your stricter contract to inherit from this interface, but a workaround for version 0.4.20 is that you can edit this interface to add stricter mutability before inheriting from your contract.  
- Solidity issue #3419: A contract that implements `OIP721Metadata` or `OIP721Enumerable` SHALL also implement `OIP721`. OIP-721 implements the requirements of interface OIP-165.  
- Solidity issue #2330: If a function is shown in this specification as `external` then a contract will be compliant if it uses `public` visibility. As a workaround for version 0.4.20, you can edit this interface to switch to `public` before inheriting from your contract.  
- Solidity issues #3494, #3544: Use of `this.*.selector` is marked as a warning by Solidity, a future version of Solidity will not mark this as an error.  
*If a newer version of Solidity allows the caveats to be expressed in code, then this OIP MAY be updated and the caveats removed, and will be equivalent to the original specification.*  
## Rationale
There are many proposed uses of OKB Chain smart contracts that depend on tracking distinguishable assets. Examples of existing or planned NFTs are LAND in Decentraland, the eponymous punks in CryptoPunks, and in-game items using systems like DMarket or EnjinCoin. Future uses include tracking real-world assets, like real-estate (as envisioned by companies like Ubitquity or Propy). It is critical in each of these cases that these items are not “lumped together” as numbers in a ledger, but instead each asset must have its ownership individually and atomically tracked. Regardless of the nature of these assets, the ecosystem will be stronger if we have a standardized interface that allows for cross-functional asset management and sales platforms.
