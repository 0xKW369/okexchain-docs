Fee Model
=========

The details of this chapter are as follows:

-  Each can obtain data on the latest traded prices. The newly listed
   pairs take the initial prices as the latest traded prices



Execute an order
----------------

**Fee conditions**

When the order is executed, a certain amount of fee is charged in
proportion to the traded amount

**Fee priority**

Use the coin finally obtained by the user to pay the handling fee

**Fee rules**

1. Execute the order first. Remove the cryptocurrency sold and add the
   cryptocurrency bought in the userâ€™s account
2. fee = the cryptocurrency bought * feeRate

**Fee parameter references**

| Operation   | Fee rate         |

| Deal        | 0.1%             |

Fees & Gas
----------

Each transaction may either supply fees or gas prices, but not both.

Validator's have a minimum gas price (multi-denom) configuration and they use
this value when when determining if they should include the transaction in a block during ``CheckTx``, where ``gasPrices >= minGasPrices``. Note, your transaction must supply fees that are greater than or equal to **any** of the denominations the validator requires.

**Note**: With such a mechanism in place, validators may start to prioritize
txs by ``gasPrice`` in the mempool, so providing higher fees or gas prices may yield higher tx priority.

e.g.

.. code:: bash

    okchainli tx send ... --fees=0.002tokt


or

.. code:: bash
    okchainli tx send ... --gas-prices=0.00000001tokt



Other fees
----------

In addition to the above fees, okchain will also charge some additional fees as ``Business fees`` for below ``Orders``.
