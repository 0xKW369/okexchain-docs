# Overview
MetaMask is a crypto wallet that you can use on your web browser or mobile devices to interact with the Ethereum network and other EVM compatible blockchains. With MetaMask, you can run Ethereum DApps without having to run a full Ethereum node.

>**Caution**
It is important to backup your **Secret Recovery Phrase** as it is the only way to recover your MetaMask accounts if your device is lost, stolen, or experiences data corruption.

Read carefully Metamask's instructions. Write this phrase on a piece of paper and store in a secure location. If you want even more security, write it down on multiple pieces of paper and store each in 2–3 different locations. You can even memorize this phrase.

5. Verify your secret phrase by selecting the previously generated phrase. When done, click Confirm.
