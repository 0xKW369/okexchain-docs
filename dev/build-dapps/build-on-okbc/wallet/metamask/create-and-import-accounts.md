# Create and Import Accounts
In case you are new to Ethereum and Metamask, here is a guide on how to create multiple accounts and import them:

## Create Account
To create multiple accounts, you click on **Profile** icon on MetaMask and then click on **Create Account**

You can create more accounts this way. When you create multiple accounts, your addresses will be different at your end.

## Import Account
The importing process on MetaMask is similar to creating a new account. You just have to copy-paste the private key (more information [here),](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key#:~:text=On%20the%20account%20page%2C%20click,click%20%E2%80%9CConfirm%E2%80%9D%20to%20proceed.
